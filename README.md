# GECOS (TSI)

Implement GECOS, a lock-free synchronisation mechanism along with other well known mechanisms: RCU, HP (Hazard Pointers), etc, for comparison purpose.

Note: for "make rcu" you will need to install URCU (https://liburcu.org/)

To compile: $ make


Example for running GECOS: ```./list_gecos.exe 10 1 300 3```
